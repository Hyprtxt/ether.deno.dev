# Gaslight.dev

Server side coding, that feel like client side react coding, without the lame parts. Except it's serverless. Wait, I mean isomorphic!

`/public` is client side assets
`/elements` and `gaslight.js` are isomorphic and may be loaded server side or client side
`*.ts` Most of the other bits are Deno typescript
`website.ts` is the entry point for yourâ€¦ application

Don't get confused!
